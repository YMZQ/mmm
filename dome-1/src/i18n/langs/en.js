      "text-2": "On the African savannah, environmentalists have discovered that elephants are natural allies in climate change - each elephant can store about 9000 tons of carbon in its lifetime, equivalent to 30000 trees. However, approximately 20000 elephants still die each year due to poaching and habitat loss.",
      "text-3": "In 2023, biologist Emma Kovac and blockchain developer Raj Patel proposed an innovative solution: combining elephant conservation with Web3 to create \"Elephant Eco\". They tokenize the ecological value of elephants through blockchain and issue EAC tokens (EAC) to connect global environmentalists, investors, and local communities.",
      "text-4": "In just 6 months, the project successfully protected 47 elephants in Zambia, tracking their ecological contributions in real-time through IoT collars and converting them into token rewards. The local community receives income, while investors receive carbon credit returns.",
      "text-5": "Today, elephant ecology is expanding to Kenya and Botswana, with the goal of protecting 1000 elephants by 2025, which is equivalent to a natural solution to build 9 million tons of carbon sink capacity. This is not only a protective action, but also a revolution in using blockchain technology to address the climate crisis.",
